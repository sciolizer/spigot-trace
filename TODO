triggers:
  any event fires
  a particular type (or subtype) of event fires
  an event fires in which some property on the event equals some value
    is null/non-null

actions:
  log (to a filter which outputs certain pieces of information)
  add to a buffer
  

let me know when a particular event fires
let me know when any subtype of a particular event fires
let me know when an


<generalized-event> = <event-type>(.<prop>((=|~)<value)?)*

= means the toString of the property matches exactly
~ means the toString of the property contains the substring


/t reflect <generalized-event>
outputs all of the properties on an event that can be watched
/t grep <query> <depth>? - outputs all generalized-events containing the query as a substring. depth defaults to 1 (i.e. only event-types, not their properties).
/t create <generalized-event>
/t delete (all|<int>|<generalized-event>)
/t on <generalized-event>
/t off (all|<int>|<generalized-event>)
/t list -- prefixes each with a number so it can be easily turned off; note that numbers are sticky - if you have 5 triggers, and you delete #3, the remaining will be #1, #2, #4, #5 - 4 and 5 are not renumbered

output of each event is 

EventType(prop=blarg)

in v2 we might aggregate these together (which would be useful for knowing when to logged events are in fact the same event

MVP:

generalized-event does not support filters
/t delete all
/t reflect <generalized-event>
/t create <generalized-event>
